Firstly i will make a concept with the site milanote.com to get my ideas on paper before coding anything. I have some simple concepts but i know i will have to tweak or add/remove features as i move forward. My overall vision is in the Readme, but i wanted to go more in depth and visual with my idea so ive made the following concept:

 this will require i watch many tutorials on youtube and do a lot of searching on google and chatgpt inquiries as i haven't used html or css in about 3 years and forgot most of it. 

 *note: im aware documentation should be professional however i'll include some personal thoughts as it helps if I need to backtrack or remember why i wanted to do something.

HTML
  - ive started by making a header with a list containing: name, github icon, linkedin icon, email icon followed by my email.
  - made it so you can click the github and linkedin icons to be taken to my socials.
  - added a div with a picture of myself aswell as a brief intro.
  - added div for goals
  


CSS
 - Imported a font i liked and declared some variables with colors.
 - removed default padding, margin and border box.
 - set the font and color for text.
 - set padding and background color for the body.
 - used "display: flex;" and google chromes flex tool to arrange divs and div contents correctly
