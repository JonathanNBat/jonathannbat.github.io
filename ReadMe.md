This will be my first project, a website to host and update the descriptions and documentation of all my projects. I have not made anything website wise in years so i will be updating and fixing this site as i go for the remainder of the projects. as of today (Nov 13 2025) my goals for the site are as follows:

 - introduction and career plans on the front page
   - current accomplishments 
   - ongoing courses (fortinet fundamentals as of writing this)

 - index of finished and ongoing projects
   - optionally in a hamburger menu on the side

 - info cards as you scroll with brief descriptions of the projects
   - the ability to click on them to go to the github project/repo
   - interactive css animations (optional)

 - header with github and other contacts (linkedin, socials i may add in the future).

I have other things goin on as i make this so i will be fairly slow to add on and make this, however i do plan on finishing it fairly quickly as i'll be adding my future projects to it as i go. 

I will be documenting my processes and progress in the Documentation.md file.
